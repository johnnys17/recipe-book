# Personal Recipe Book

A responsive and visually appealing recipe book webpage, crafted as part of my journey to become a full-stack engineer. This project showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, and grid layout, featuring a collection of six favorite recipes—Spaghetti Carbonara, Chicken Curry, Chocolate Cake, Vegetable Stir-Fry, Lemon Garlic Salmon, and Banana Bread—with interactive overlays and a food-inspired earthy design. The site is optimized for a seamless experience across devices, reflecting my focus on usability and aesthetics.

Built to hone my front-end development abilities, this webpage serves as a key piece in my portfolio. The use of CSS Grid ensures a flexible, modern layout, while overlays demonstrate dynamic styling. Future enhancements could include JavaScript for advanced interactivity, such as a searchable recipe database.
